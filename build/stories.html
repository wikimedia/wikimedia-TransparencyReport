    <h3>By Any Other Name<br><small>April 2016</small></h3>
    <p>Sometimes, public figures are upset that Wikipedia articles contain the most basic information: for example, their name. An author with a pen name; a famous comedian who performs pseudonymously; and a musical group that uses stage names—all contacted us earlier this year to have their names removed from Wikipedia articles. Decisions about what well-sourced information should be on the projects belong to the Wikimedia communities. We directed them to the editors of <a href='https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portada'>Galician</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English</a>, and <a href='https://fr.wikipedia.org'>French Wikipedia</a>, who can evaluate the sources provided for these names and determine whether or not to remove them.</p>

    <h3>Dictating Content<br><small>April 2016</small></h3>
    <p>We occasionally receive requests from governments to remove content that those governments may find offensive—even content that is perfectly legal elsewhere. In April, we received an email from the Information and Communication Technologies Authority of the Turkish government, claiming that the Turkish Wikipedia article on <a href='//tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BC%C5%9Ffik_diktat%C3%B6rl%C3%BCk'><em>Müşfik diktatörlük</em></a> (benevolent dictatorship) violated Turkish law. We rejected the request, and offered to pass the message on to <a href='//tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Sayfa'>Turkish Wikipedia</a> volunteers. The projects belong to the contributors, readers, and other members of the Wikimedia communities, and we believe that where possible they should decide what content belongs on the projects.</p>

    <h3>Happy Hour<br><small>June 2016</small></h3>
    <p>Occasionally, businesses will claim that Wikipedia articles about their products are unlawful—or, in this case, &ldquo;illicit&rdquo;. This happened in June, when an alcoholic beverage organization emailed us, arguing that an international treaty restricted <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org'>English Wikipedia</a> editors from referring to the organization’s region-specific alcoholic beverage by a generic name. We rejected the request and informed the organization that neither trademark law nor international treaties prevent Wikimedia communities from discussing that product or similar products. We also informed them that they were welcome to work with the volunteers to discuss the proper labeling of their favored drink.</p>

    <h3>Feel the Bern<br><small>January 2016</small></h3>
    <p>In January, we received a DMCA from the campaign of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders'>Bernie Sanders</a>, a U.S. presidential primary candidate. They asked us to remove campaign logos from <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>. We cautioned them that the notice would be posted to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(website)'>Lumen</a>, which could trigger a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect'>Streisand effect</a>. They refused to withdraw the DMCA, so we removed the logos. The next day, <em>Ars Technica</em> <a href='//arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/bernie-sanders-campaign-sends-dmca-notice-to-wikipedia-over-logos/'>wrote</a> about the takedown, and we received a <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/DMCA_Policy#If_you_are_an_uploader_of_content.E2.80.A6'>counter-notice</a> from a Wikimedia user. We spoke with the Sanders campaign about the counter-notice, and were happy to hear they had decided to rescind their DMCA. The logos have been restored.</p>

    <h3>DMCA Poster Child<br><small>February 2016</small></h3>
    <p>It’s not unusual to see movie posters or billboards long before a film is released, or for an upcoming movie to have a Wikipedia article written about it. Before a recent action movie hit theatres, <a href='https://ru.wikipedia.org/'>Russian Wikipedia</a> editors created an article about it, which included an image of one of the film’s posters. The studio behind the film contacted us in February with a DMCA notice requesting that the poster be removed from the site. However, we analyzed the request and refused it. The poster had been widely distributed to promote the movie, and it was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use'>fair use</a> for editors to feature its image in an article informing readers about the film.</p>

    <h3>Reuse Ruse<br><small>June 2016</small></h3>
    <p>We encourage the public to reuse Wikimedia content under our many free licenses. However, we ask that reusers respect those licenses and refrain from claiming copyright ownership of that content. This is what happened in June, when we received a DMCA notice from an Asian newspaper claiming that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> had copied content from one of its articles. When we investigated, it turned out to be the opposite: the newspaper had copied the content from Wikipedia. We rejected the DMCA and provided a link to one of the community’s many guides on properly <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_content'>reusing Wikipedia content.</a></p>

    <p>It’s not uncommon for bands to break up or change members. It is uncommon for previous band members to contact us about what other members are writing on Wikipedia. We received an email from purported former members of a dance group, seeking to control the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article about the group. They argued that edits made by other members infringed their trademark. We explained that writing an article about a notable topic is not infringement, and suggested that they work with the Wikipedia editor community if they’d like to improve the article.</p>

    <h3>Copywrong<br><small>October 2015</small></h3>
    <p>Owning a copy of a photograph is not the same thing as owning the copyright to that photograph. This is an important principle of copyright law. We received a handful of requests to remove photos from the projects in which the requesting parties argued that because they owned a photo, they owned the copyright. For example, one request concerned a photo of an American author. Since that picture is in the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a>, it could be freely posted. We explained this to the requester, and the image remains on the Wikimedia projects.</p>

    <p>An online rights agent representing an international pop star contacted us regarding the Romanian Wikipedia article about their client.

The agent asked us to change the article directly. We told them that the Foundation does not write or edit the projects, and explained they could provide our volunteer editors with reliable sources that included the correct name.</p>

    <p>Wikimedia editors work hard to ensure that media is uploaded to the projects under the appropriate license, even going beyond the requirements of copyright law in some cases. Due to their efforts, we receive relatively few DMCA notices, and we carefully evaluate the notices we do get. When we received a DMCA from a design group concerning a photo of one of their products on <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>, we denied it, because the request didn’t meet the law’s stringent standards. However, the community had concerns about the license, and decided on its own to remove the photo.</p>

    <p>Sometimes a requester won’t take no for an answer, even when the law isn’t on their side. Last year, we received an email from a public relations firm that wanted us to remove an image of a rapper on <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>. Not terribly unusual—except that in September 2014, we had already explained to the same requester that the photo was properly licensed (see the <a href='//transparency.wikimedia.org/stories.html'>story</a> “No Take Backsies”, which originally appeared in our January 2015 Transparency Report). We denied this second request on the same grounds.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the diligence of the Wikimedia community, the Wikimedia Foundation receives a relatively small number of DMCA takedown notices. Most of these notices tend to concern photographs; however, on occasion, some allege that copyrighted text has appeared on the projects. We received a DMCA notice from a publishing company stating that text from one of its classic children’s books—the complete text of the book, in fact—had been posted on <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a>. When we confirmed that the entire book had been improperly copied onto the projects, we removed the copyrighted text.</p>

    <p>We carefully evaluate every DMCA notice we receive, but the job is easier when the requester provides all of the necessary information. Recently, we complied with two DMCA notices from a stock photo agency. One concerned a photo of a red fox, the other a Nepalese mountain. They also requested a third photo be removed, but as is often the case, the community noticed the improper copyright permissions and proactively removed it before we got the chance to. In each case, the agency had followed the template for DMCA requests, facilitating our review and consequently the removal of their content.</p>

Unfortunately, we recently received a DMCA request about one of the many barnstar images available across Wikimedia projects. Someone had uploaded a unique 'Home-Made Barnstar' from an arts and crafts site without permission to use the star. We evaluated the request, and removed the image. Don’t worry, though: you can still get a homemade barnstar. There are freely licensed barnstars, like <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Homemadebarnstar.png'>this one</a>, just waiting to be discovered and awarded.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, we get takedown requests for websites that we do not operate. In most cases, we explain to the requester that they’ve contacted the wrong party, and don’t hear from them again. But recently, a company sent us three separate DMCA requests, asking that we remove certain allegedly proprietary content from our sites. The problem? Wikimedia is not associated with any of the sites in question. The company apparently thought that all sites that include the word 'wiki' in the URL or use <a href='//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki'>MediaWiki software</a> are Wikimedia projects. We explained that isn't the case, but they continued to send us DMCA notices.</p>

As permitted by our privacy policy, we alerted local police, passing on the IP address and details we had about the threat. The police informed us they had located and arrested the person in question, who allegedly had weapons available and reportedly confessed.</p>

    <p>On rare occasions we discover threats against public figures. This is uncommon, but something that happens on large websites. An individual had made specific, graphic threats against President <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama'>Barack Obama</a>. This is contrary to our policies, and against U.S. law. In cases of potential serious harm to a person, our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#To_Protect_You.2C_Ourselves_.26_Others'>Privacy Policy</a> allows us to disclose relevant information. We immediately took action, reporting the user’s <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'>IP address</a>, <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent'>user agent information</a>, and email address to the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service'>United States Secret Service</a>.</p>

    <p> Authorities <a href='//www.afsp.org/preventing-suicide/frequently-asked-questions'>advise</a> contacting emergency services when a loved one threatens suicide. When someone shared what appeared to be a credible intent to commit suicide, we notified their local police department. The person was able to get medical help, and later let us know they were okay. If you are considering suicide, please <a href='//www.afsp.org/preventing-suicide/find-help'>seek out a mental health professional immediately</a>. You can also contact emergency services; visit an emergency room or psychiatric walk-in clinic; or call a <a href='//www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres'>suicide prevention hotline</a>.</p>

    <p>A publishing company sent us a takedown request concerning four famous works on <a href='//wikisource.org/'>Wikisource</a>: French translations of <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen'>Jane Austen's</a> <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Cinq_Filles_de_Mrs_Bennet'><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></a> and <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Persuasion'><em>Persuasion</em></a>, a French translation of <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle'>Arthur Conan Doyle's</a> <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Aventures_de_Sherlock_Holmes'><em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em></a>, and <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_la_Fontaine'>Jean de la Fontaine’s</a> <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Fables_de_La_Fontaine,_livres_I-III'><em>Fables</em></a>.
