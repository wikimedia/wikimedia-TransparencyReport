    <p>We report two types of emergency disclosures, which happen on rare occasions.</p>
    <p>First, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> provides an expedited process for law enforcement to request user data from websites in cases of immediate threat to life or limb. We call these &ldquo;emergency requests&rdquo;.

    <p>Second, we proactively contact the authorities when we become aware of troubling statements on the projects, such as suicide threats or bomb threats. We take these statements seriously and assess each one individually, contacting law enforcement as appropriate to help resolve the issue. We call these &ldquo;voluntary disclosures.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The stories below are real. They are also meant to be illustrative of the kinds of situations that would warrant a possible emergency disclosure of user information.

When an anonymous poster made an alleged bomb threat, we found that the edit was made from an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'>IP address</a> that was near the apparent threat location. As permitted by our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#sharing'>Privacy Policy</a>, we alerted local police, passing on the IP address and details we had about the threat. The police informed us they had located and arrested the person in question, who allegedly had weapons available and reportedly confessed."

    story_protecting_schools_body: "Our community members are vigilant. We work with them to address rare threats of harm that they encounter on the Wikimedia projects. In one such case, community members told us about a shooting threat, made against a school in the United States.

If you are considering suicide, please <a href='https://www.afsp.org/preventing-suicide/find-help'>seek out a mental health professional immediately</a>.

A female <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebes_crested_macaque'>crested black macaque monkey</a> got ahold of the camera and took a series of pictures, including some self-portraits. The pictures were featured in an online newspaper article and eventually posted to <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/'>Commons</a>. We received a takedown request from the photographer, claiming that he owned the copyright to the photographs. We didn't agree, so we denied the request."
    story3_title: "Aboriginal Language<br><small>July 2012</small>"
    story3_body: "A Tasmanian aboriginal language center demanded the removal of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org'>English Wikipedia</a> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palawa_kani'>article on 'palawa kani'</a>, claiming copyright over the entirety of the language. We refused to remove the article because copyright law simply cannot be used to stop people from using an entire language or to prevent general discussion about the language. Such a broad claim would have chilled free speech and negatively impacted research, education, and public discourse—activities that Wikimedia serves to promote."

    story_identity_title: "Mistaken Identity<br><small>January, March, and May 2015</small>"
    story_identity_body: "Sometimes, we get takedown requests for websites that we do not operate. In most cases, we explain to the requester that they’ve contacted the wrong party, and don’t hear from them again. But recently, a company sent us three separate DMCA requests, asking that we remove certain allegedly proprietary content from our sites. The problem? Wikimedia is not associated with any of the sites in question. The company apparently thought that all sites that include the word 'wiki' in the URL or use <a href='https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki'>MediaWiki software</a> are Wikimedia projects. We explained that isn't the case, but they continued to send us DMCA notices."

    story_barnstar_title: "Home-Made Barnstar<br><small>March 2015</small>"
    story_barnstar_body: "The Wikimedia community is large and diverse, but has many things in common: for example, who doesn’t like getting a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars'>barnstar</a> to recognize their good work on the Projects? Unfortunately, we recently received a DMCA request about one of the many barnstar images available across Wikimedia projects. Someone had uploaded a unique 'Home-Made Barnstar' from an arts and crafts site without permission to use the star. We evaluated the request, and removed the image. Don’t worry, though: you can still get a homemade barnstar. There are freely licensed barnstars, like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Homemadebarnstar.png'>this one</a>, just waiting to be discovered and awarded."

    story_stock_title: "The Right Way<br><small>March and April 2015</small>"
    story_stock_body: "We carefully evaluate every DMCA notice we receive, but the job is easier when the requester provides all of the necessary information. Recently, we complied with two DMCA notices from a stock photo agency. One concerned a photo of a red fox, the other a Nepalese mountain. They also requested a third photo be removed, but as is often the case, the community noticed the improper copyright permissions and proactively removed it before we got the chance to. In each case, the agency had followed the template for DMCA requests, facilitating our review and consequently the removal of their content."

    story_cinema_title: "DMCA Poster Child<br><small>February 2016</small>"
    story_cinema_body: "It’s not unusual to see movie posters or billboards long before a film is released, or for an upcoming movie to have a Wikipedia article written about it. Before a recent action movie hit theatres, <a href='https://ru.wikipedia.org/'>Russian Wikipedia</a> editors created an article about it, which included an image of one of the film’s posters. The studio behind the film contacted us in February with a DMCA notice requesting that the poster be removed from the site. However, we analyzed the request and refused it. The poster had been widely distributed to promote the movie, and it was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use'>fair use</a> for editors to feature its image in an article informing readers about the film."

    story_dance_title: "Dance Off<br><small>November 2015</small>"
    story_dance_body: "It’s not uncommon for bands to break up or change members. It is uncommon for previous band members to contact us about what other members are writing on Wikipedia. We received an email from purported former members of a dance group, seeking to control the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article about the group. They argued that edits made by other members infringed their trademark. We explained that writing an article about a notable topic is not infringement, and suggested that they work with the Wikipedia editor community if they’d like to improve the article."

    story_copywrong_title: "Copywrong<br><small>October 2015</small>"
    story_copywrong_body: "Owning a copy of a photograph is not the same thing as owning the copyright to that photograph. This is an important principle of copyright law. We received a handful of requests to remove photos from the projects in which the requesting parties argued that because they owned a photo, they owned the copyright. For example, one request concerned a photo of an American author. Since that picture is in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a>, it could be freely posted. We explained this to the requester, and the image remains on the Wikimedia projects."

    story_change_title: "Hello, My Name Is…<br><small>October 2015</small>"
    story_change_body: "An online rights agent representing an international pop star contacted us regarding the Romanian Wikipedia article about their client. They claimed that a reporter had published inaccurate information about the musician’s birth name, which had made its way into reputable secondary sources, and eventually onto Wikipedia. The agent asked us to change the article directly. We told them that the Foundation does not write or edit the projects, and explained they could provide our volunteer editors with reliable sources that included the correct name."

    story_principle_title: "<a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope/Precautionary_principle'>Precautionary Principle</a><br><small>October 2015</small>"
    story_principle_body: "Wikimedia editors work hard to ensure that media is uploaded to the projects under the appropriate license, even going beyond the requirements of copyright law in some cases. Due to their efforts, we receive relatively few DMCA notices, and we carefully evaluate the notices we do get. When we received a DMCA from a design group concerning a photo of one of their products on <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>, we denied it, because the request didn’t meet the law’s stringent standards. However, the community had concerns about the license, and decided on its own to remove the photo."

    story_letitgo_title: "Let It Go<br><small>December 2015</small>"
    story_letitgo_body: "Sometimes a requester won’t take no for an answer, even when the law isn’t on their side. Last year, we received an email from a public relations firm that wanted us to remove an image of a rapper on <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>. Not terribly unusual—except that in September 2014, we had already explained to the same requester that the photo was properly licensed (see the <a href='https://transparency.wikimedia.org/stories.html'>story</a> “No Take Backsies”, which originally appeared in our January 2015 Transparency Report). We denied this second request on the same grounds."

    story_bedtime_title: "Bedtime Story<br><small>December 2015</small>"
    story_bedtime_body: "Thanks to the diligence of the Wikimedia community, the Wikimedia Foundation receives a relatively small number of DMCA takedown notices. Most of these notices tend to concern photographs; however, on occasion, some allege that copyrighted text has appeared on the projects. We received a DMCA notice from a publishing company stating that text from one of its classic children’s books—the complete text of the book, in fact—had been posted on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a>. When we confirmed that the entire book had been improperly copied onto the projects, we removed the copyrighted text."

    story_bern_title: "Feel the Bern<br><small>January 2016</small>"
    story_bern_body: "In January, we received a DMCA from the campaign of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders'>Bernie Sanders</a>, a U.S. presidential primary candidate. They asked us to remove campaign logos from <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>. We cautioned them that the notice would be posted to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(website)'>Lumen</a>, which could trigger a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect'>Streisand effect</a>. They refused to withdraw the DMCA, so we removed the logos. The next day, <em>Ars Technica</em> <a href='https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/bernie-sanders-campaign-sends-dmca-notice-to-wikipedia-over-logos/'>wrote</a> about the takedown, and we received a <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/DMCA_Policy#If_you_are_an_uploader_of_content.E2.80.A6'>counter-notice</a> from a Wikimedia user. We spoke with the Sanders campaign about the counter-notice, and were happy to hear they had decided to rescind their DMCA. The logos have been restored."

    story_newspaper_title: "Reuse Ruse<br><small>June 2016</small>"
    story_newspaper_body: "We encourage the public to reuse Wikimedia content under our many free licenses. However, we ask that reusers respect those licenses and refrain from claiming copyright ownership of that content. This is what happened in June, when we received a DMCA notice from an Asian newspaper claiming that <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> had copied content from one of its articles. When we investigated, it turned out to be the opposite: the newspaper had copied the content from Wikipedia. We rejected the DMCA and provided a link to one of the community’s many guides on properly <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_content'>reusing Wikipedia content.</a>"


    story_political_title: "Political Points<br><small>March 2015</small>"
    story_political_body: "A lawyer reached out to us on behalf of a lesser-known North American political party that was unhappy with edits to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> articles about the party and one of its leaders. Her clients apparently wanted previous, more promotional versions of the articles restored in place of the later versions. To better engage in discussions with the community, we encouraged them to familiarize themselves with Wikipedia's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Information_style_and_tone'>recommendations on style and tone</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_or_means_of_promotion'>policy restricting use of promotional language</a>. We also advised that one of the best ways to resolve their concerns is to engage with the community directly."

    story_guru_title: "Citation Needed<br><small>January 2015</small>"
    story_guru_body: "A self-identified religious group wrote us, requesting that we remove multiple <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> articles. As support for their request, they cited a self-publication declaring that the founder of their tradition is the ruler of the universe. We explained that the Wikimedia Foundation does not edit or curate content on Wikipedia, and that if they were concerned about inaccuracies, they could consult Wikipedia's experienced volunteer editors. We also directed them to Wikipedia’s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability'>policy on verifiability</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources'>guide to identifying reliable sources</a>, so that they could better understand the standards applied to Wikipedia articles and permissible sources to cite in those articles."

    story_kempler_title: "Copyrighting Facts<br><small>May 2015</small>"
    story_kempler_body: "A user contacted us to express concern about an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article on a famous work of art. They wanted to remove a single sentence, on the grounds that the sentence infringed their claimed copyright in a theory they had published some years ago. We explained to them that it is impossible to copyright an idea or a short statement of fact. They could copyright their article, but not the theories contained within. If the community thought the idea was interesting or notable and complied with Wikipedia’s policies, it was free to include it in the article."

    story_myanmar_title: "Unredacted<br><small>August 2014</small>"
    story_myanmar_body: "When a blogger included a photo of his visa to visit <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma#Etymology'>Burma/Myanmar</a> on his website, he had scrubbed his personal details from the image. He never expected the same picture to show up on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> in an article about the country's visa policy -- with the redactions removed and his information exposed. He wrote to us, asking to remove the photo. Given the nature of the information and the circumstances of how it was exposed, we took the image down."

    story_coffee_title: "Grounds for Removal<br><small>July 2014</small>"
    story_coffee_body: "A nutritional supplement company requested the removal of all references to the term &ldquo;coffee berries&rdquo; from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee'>coffee</a>, claiming both inaccuracy and infringement of their trademark, COFFEEBERRY&reg;. We responded that the community of editors felt that &ldquo;coffee berry&rdquo; was an acceptable term to refer to the fruit of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea'>coffee plant</a>. We also explained that trademarking a pre-existing word cannot prevent others from using the word for its original meaning. Trademark rights simply don’t give companies total control over everyday words."

    story_seer_title: "A Murky Future<br><small>October 2014</small>"
    story_seer_body: "A law firm representing an astrologer asked that we remove a <a href='https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal'>French Wikipedia</a> article that chronicled her history of allegedly false predictions. Unusually, they cited Wikipedia’s own <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons'>policy on biographies of living persons</a> as a source of the article’s problems. We explained that the Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit Wikipedia articles. We asked that they engage with the French Wikipedia community of volunteer editors and follow Wikipedia policies to address any issues of alleged inaccuracies with the community. "

    story_dmca_title: "Doubling Down on DMCA<br><small>December 2014</small>"
    story_dmca_body: "Takedown notices play an important role in guarding against copyright infringement. However, there must be transparency surrounding the use of takedown notices, which is why we post the notices we receive on a <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Category:DMCA'>dedicated page</a> and report them to <a href='chillingeffects.org'>Chilling Effects</a>. In a totally absurd twist, we received a DMCA takedown notice to remove a previously filed DMCA takedown notice from the same individual. The sender also claimed that the second DMCA notice itself was subject to copyright and could not be posted. We declined the request and posted it as we would any other DMCA takedown notice."

    story_mistake_title: "A Common(s) Mistake<br><small>July 2014</small>"
    story_mistake_body: "When a photographer uploaded his photograph to Flickr, he knew that he was making it available for public view, but he didn’t intend for anyone to be able to copy it, and he didn’t license it for reuse. When he found it on <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>, he sent us a DMCA takedown notice letting us know that it had been uploaded to Commons without his permission. After investigating, we determined that he really did own the image and had not licensed it for reuse on Flickr or elsewhere. We therefore removed the image."

    story_studio_title: "No Take Backsies<br><small>September 2014</small>"
    story_studio_body: "A public relations company demanded that we remove an image of a rapper. However, the photo had been freely licensed under <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> policy apparently by the artist and claimed holder of the copyright. Therefore, we declined to remove it. The PR company initially alleged that the portrayed musician was someone different from the rapper. They later appeared to suggest that the rapper had never intended to give his permission. As the story seemed to change, the community examined, and then re-examined, the original permission. In the end the community found that the image should be kept."

    story_dictating_title: "Dictating Content<br><small>April 2016</small>"
    story_dictating_body: "We occasionally receive requests from governments to remove content that those governments may find offensive—even content that is perfectly legal elsewhere. In April, we received an email from the Information and Communication Technologies Authority of the Turkish government, claiming that the Turkish Wikipedia article on <a href='https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BC%C5%9Ffik_diktat%C3%B6rl%C3%BCk'><em>Müşfik diktatörlük</em></a> (benevolent dictatorship) violated Turkish law. We rejected the request, and offered to pass the message on to <a href='https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Sayfa'>Turkish Wikipedia</a> volunteers. The projects belong to the contributors, readers, and other members of the Wikimedia communities, and we believe that where possible they should decide what content belongs on the projects."

    story_whisky_title: "Happy Hour<br><small>June 2016</small>"
    story_whisky_body: "Occasionally, businesses will claim that Wikipedia articles about their products are unlawful—or, in this case, &ldquo;illicit&rdquo;. This happened in June, when an alcoholic beverage organization emailed us, arguing that an international treaty restricted <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org'>English Wikipedia</a> editors from referring to the organization’s region-specific alcoholic beverage by a generic name. We rejected the request and informed the organization that neither trademark law nor international treaties prevent Wikimedia communities from discussing that product or similar products. We also informed them that they were welcome to work with the volunteers to discuss the proper labeling of their favored drink."

    story_zanni_title: "By Any Other Name<br><small>April 2016</small>"
    story_zanni_body: "Sometimes, public figures are upset that Wikipedia articles contain the most basic information: for example, their name. An author with a pen name; a famous comedian who performs pseudonymously; and a musical group that uses stage names—all contacted us earlier this year to have their names removed from Wikipedia articles. Decisions about what well-sourced information should be on the projects belong to the Wikimedia communities. We directed them to the editors of <a href='https://gl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portada'>Galician</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English</a>, and <a href='https://fr.wikipedia.org'>French Wikipedia</a>, who can evaluate the sources provided for these names and determine whether or not to remove them."

    story_disputed_title: "Disputed Territory<br><small>October and November 2016</small>"
    story_disputed_body: "The Wikimedia projects exist to provide everyone with free knowledge. Sometimes, people disagree about whether certain information should be available. In October and November, we received two separate emails complaining about the existence of an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article on a historically disputed region. The article adheres to Wikipedia’s rules of neutrality and accuracy, and covers an important historical subject. These emailers are welcome to discuss potential changes on the article <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_talk_pages'>talk page</a>. We support the community’s prerogative to present neutral, accurate information about sometimes controversial topics on the projects."

    story_dial_title: "Dial W for Wiki<br><small>September 2016</small>"
    story_dial_body: "Most people contact us by email to ask for changes to project content, but we occasionally get phone calls, too. In September, someone left a lengthy voicemail, sharing a complicated tale about political corruption and violence in small-town North America. It seems that they wanted us to update the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article about a specific city and county to include some of the information in the story. Of course, we don’t update the projects, but if they have reliable and neutral sources, they are welcome to edit the page themselves or contact the volunteer editors."

    story_trademark_title: "Trademark Tag<br><small>July 2016</small>"
    story_trademark_body: "A major North American transit authority emailed us in July, requesting that we remove their logo from <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> because it was trademarked. We explained that this does not violate trademark law; it is not a commercial use, and there is no chance of confusing viewers. This is an example of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_use'>nominative fair use</a>, as the image is used to illustrate Wikipedia articles about the authority. However, we offered to forward their concerns to experienced Commons volunteers, who chose to to put a note on the page mentioning that the image is trademarked."

    story_license_title: "License to Share<br><small>August 2016</small>"
    story_license_body: "Most content on the Wikimedia projects is within the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a> or freely licensed, often under a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons'>Creative Commons</a> license. We encourage everyone to read and understand these licenses before contributing. A photographer sent us a DMCA notice in August. They had uploaded their work to <a href='https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoofdpagina'>Dutch Wikipedia</a> under a <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en'>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license</a>, but became concerned when the images were reused elsewhere. We explained that the license’s terms encourage reuse, as long as the attribution and ShareAlike rules are followed. They understood, and we hope they continue to contribute to the projects."

    story_grave__title: "Grave Questions<br><small>October 2016</small>"
    story_grave__body: "Whenever we receive a DMCA, we investigate the content and carefully evaluate the copyright claim. In October, an artist submitted a DMCA notice for a photo on <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>. The photo showed a tombstone, which bore an allegedly copyrighted art design. Since the cemetery was quite old, we wanted to ensure that it was an original design, and not merely a similar pattern from over 100 years ago, which would now be in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a>. After an interesting research detour through the world of 19th-century cemeteries and traditional memorial art, we granted the DMCA."

    story_missing_link_title: "The Missing Link<br><small>October 2016</small>"
    story_missing_link_body: "We received an incomplete DMCA notice in October, claiming that a picture on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> was a still image from a copyrighted film. The photo itself purported to show a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology'>famous</a> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids#List_of_cryptids'>cryptid</a> (appropriately, we received the message on Halloween). We asked the requester to resubmit the notice with all the information required under the DMCA. They did not do so, and the photo remains on the projects. As for the creature, we’re not sure if it’s been spotted again—but if it is, we’re sure you’ll be able to read about it on Wikipedia."

    story_unreliable_title: "Unreliable Source<br><small>May 2017</small>"
    story_unreliable_body: "People who contact the Wikimedia Foundation or experienced project volunteers to request changes to the Wikimedia projects are encouraged to provide evidence or cite <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources'>reliable sources</a> to support their views. In one recent case, a European performer asked that their birth date be changed in an article on <a href='https://fr.wikipedia.org'>French Wikipedia</a>. However, there were two problems with the identification they provided as evidence: it was a primary and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources'>not a secondary source</a>, and it appeared to be fake. In a later email, the requester indicated that it was actually a movie or television prop. The original information and sources remain in the article."

    story_jury_title: "Jury Trial<br><small>February and March 2017</small>"
    story_jury_body: "We received two requests from lawyers representing clients awaiting trial, asking that we remove information from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org'>English Wikipedia</a> that could allegedly impact the outcome of the cases. We explained that the user community would be unlikely to remove well-sourced information, but that they could discuss their concerns with experienced volunteers. Jury integrity is a serious issue, and countries balance the rights of the accused and the free expression rights of the public differently. We believe that the public’s right to access accurate information need not be so restricted. If a court is concerned about information available to jurors, a better remedy is careful instruction or sequestration."

    story_official_use_title: "For Official Use<br><small>May 2017</small>"
    story_official_use_body: "A photographer contacted us about removing from <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> a photograph of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump'>Donald Trump</a>. They claimed the photograph was licensed only for the presidential transition team and U.S. government to use. However, the photo has been adopted by the White House for several official uses, and the whitehouse.gov copyright policy places the photo under a Creative Commons license. Due to the confusion about the copyright status of the photograph, experienced Commons volunteers decided to remove the image for now. We encourage governments everywhere to make official portraits and documents freely available to the public, and to be clear about their licensing policies."

    story_dark_matter_title: "A Dark Matter<br><small>March 2017</small>"
    story_dark_matter_body: "A photographer submitted a DMCA notice for a photo of an astronomical phenomenon that was used to illustrate an article on <a href='https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page'>English Wikiversity</a>. They also demanded that we pay them a fine, which they argued was required by the laws of their country. We examined their claims, evaluating the photo’s appearance on Wikiversity and the project’s <a href='https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Free_content'>content</a> and <a href='https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Fair_use'>fair use</a> policies. After some research and consideration, we decided to grant the DMCA. However, we refused to acquiesce to their erroneous demands for money."

    story_deletion_title: "Deletion Discussion<br><small>February 2017</small>"
    story_deletion_body: "The Wikimedia community works hard to ensure that all material on the projects is properly licensed. In February, a photographer sent us a DMCA notice requesting the removal of a photo they claimed had been taken from their website. It turned out that the photo was already at the center of an ongoing deletion discussion. We notified them of the discussion, and let them know they could submit a complete DMCA if they wished. But just a few days later, the community decided to delete that photo and a few others that failed to comply with <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing'>Wikimedia Commons’ licensing policy.</a>"

    story_missing_title: "Missing Piece<br><small>March 2017</small>"
    story_missing_body: "DMCA notices must include certain information. When we receive a notice that is lacking, we ask the requester to provide the missing details. In March, we got a partial DMCA notice from someone who claimed that a picture on <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> had previously appeared on their website. We asked them for the missing information. They replied, but still omitted something important: evidence to demonstrate that they held copyright in the photo. We explained that once they had provided this, we could evaluate their DMCA. They did not respond, and the photo remains on the projects."

    story_count_me_title: "Count Me In<br><small>July 2017</small>"
    story_count_me_body: "Many of the messages we receive are requests to change or remove information on the projects. However, some people want to add information to Wikipedia. One emailer was very keen to have an article created about themselves. They sent a message in five different major languages, to us, to the volunteer contributors of <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias'>several different Wikipedias</a>, and even to a handful of <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_chapters'>Wikimedia chapters</a>. The email stated that they are an accomplished philosopher and scientist. If they meet the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability'>Notability</a> requirements for an article, maybe one of the volunteer editors will create one."

    story_political_discussions_title: "Political Discussions<br><small>July 2017</small>"
    story_political_discussions_body: "In July, we received a message from a government communications office. The emailer was concerned that the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article about a high-level government official had become the site of a battle between opposing political sides. They had not edited the page, but sought advice on how to keep it neutral. We commended them for noting the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest'>Conflict of interest policy</a> and not editing the page, and explained that they should feel free to engage with volunteer contributors on the article’s talk page, while disclosing their position and interest."

    story_room_title: "Room for Improvement<br><small>September 2017</small>"
    story_room_body: "A representative for an eccentric filmmaker repeatedly contacted volunteer editors, demanding changes be made to the filmmaker’s biography on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a>. They wanted to correct information about the filmmaker's name and national origin, claiming that the information currently on Wikipedia was stigmatizing. An experienced volunteer investigated the claim, and found that the information in the article was well-sourced. They suggested that the requester contact the news website cited to support the challenged information. In subsequent interviews reported in multiple news sources, the filmmaker provided additional information about their background, leading Wikipedia editors to modify the article."

    story_spoiler_title: "Spoiler Alert<br><small>September 2017</small>"
    story_spoiler_body: "Most DMCA notices we receive relate to photographs, although other types of information can of course be copyrighted. In September, a production company located in the Middle East emailed us to request the removal of written content on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> that related to a television show. The information concerned an upcoming season of the show, and may have given away important events before the program aired. We evaluated the request, and investigated whether or not the information in question was copyrightable and covered by the DMCA. However, before we completed our review, the article was examined by volunteers, who chose to remove the information."

    story_quantity_quality_title: "Quantity over Quality<br><small>December 2017</small>"
    story_quantity_quality_body: "In December, we received several emails from multiple email addresses under different names, all writing about the same few articles on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> and <a href='https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikivoyage</a>. The sender claimed that the articles, and some maps contained in them, violated their copyright, and sent us links to another website as proof. When we looked into it, however, we found that their articles and maps were different from those on the projects. Even stranger, the sender’s articles acknowledged that they were adapted from Wikipedia. We encourage people to reuse content from the Wikimedia projects, but they should understand that the originals will remain a common resource for everyone."

    story_fair_share_title: "Fair to Share<br><small>September 2017</small>"
    story_fair_share_body: "Volunteer contributors work hard to ensure that all content on the Wikimedia projects is appropriately licensed. However, we do receive a handful of legitimate DMCA notices. In September 2017, a photographer contacted us about a picture of a musician on <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>. We determined the request was valid, and removed the image. The following month, the same photographer contacted us again about a picture of an author on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a>. As the author was deceased and the photo cannot be easily replaced, the image bore a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use'>fair use</a> tag. We agreed with this conclusion, and the picture remains on the projects."

    story_turkey_title: "#WeMissTurkey<br><small>May 2018</small>"
    story_turkey_body: "In May, we received a request from a Turkish government agency to remove a large category of photos from Wikimedia Commons, which we denied. A previous request in April 2017 has resulted in all languages of Wikipedia being blocked in Turkey for over a year. Since that time, the 80 million people of Turkey have been denied access to free knowledge, while the rest of the world has lost the opportunity to learn from the people of Turkey on Wikipedia. We remain committed to restoring access to Wikipedia in its entirety in Turkey and protecting free knowledge globally."

    story_multiplying_title: "Multiplying Knowledge<br><small>January 2018</small>"
    story_multiplying_body: "An individual wrote to us in January asking us to remove an image of a mathematical diagram on English Wikipedia that was being used to illustrate an abstract concept. Because the requestor had created a different diagram illustrating the same idea, they alleged that the version on the Wikimedia projects infringed their intellectual property. We did not grant their request. Generally, simple numerical diagrams are not <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Threshold_of_originality'>sufficiently original</a> to merit protection under copyright laws, and such diagrams of mathematical concepts are ineligible for other kinds of intellectual property protection. We believe that these tools should be freely available to everybody."

    story_territorial_title: "Getting Territorial<br><small>Multiple months</small>"
    story_territorial_body: "The Wikimedia projects contain all kinds of information for historical and educational purposes. When writing about geography, volunteer contributors must decide how to write about disputed territories and places known by multiple names, balancing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources'>reliable sources</a> and viewpoints to choose the most accurate phrasing. In the past six months, we received four requests—including from one country’s government—asking us to change how various locations are described on multiple projects. The writers cited international and local laws to support their arguments. We didn’t make any edits, of course; the emailers can join the conversation and present their views to other community members."

    story_copyright_confusion_title: "Copyright Confusion<br><small>February & May 2018</small>"
    story_copyright_confusion_body: "In February and May, we were contacted by an anti-piracy organization, which asked us to remove the English Wikipedia article about a suspected film piracy ring. They submitted a DMCA request to us, even though the article did not include copyrighted material, and also made unclear demands related to trademark law. Because the article lacked any copyrighted content, we denied the request. However, volunteer editors ultimately deleted the article due to lack of notability. Contributors work hard to remove content that doesn’t meet the Wikipedia community’s encyclopedic standards. The DMCA should only be cited when copyrighted content is involved, not in general takedown demands."

    story_mayhem_title: "Museum Mayhem<br><small>February 2018</small>"
    story_mayhem_body: "Wikimedia contributors respect copyright, which is why we receive very few DMCA takedown notices. When an American museum sent us such a notice with a long list of allegedly infringing images on Wikimedia Commons, we investigated. The museum did not provide evidence of ownership of any of the images. Additionally, we discovered that many of the works were quite old; their copyright had expired, and they had entered the public domain. We contacted the museum for more information, but received no response. Copyright terms should be relatively short, so works of art can enter the public domain, and people everywhere can freely access and learn from them."

    story_decorative_title: "Decorative DMCA<br><small>January 2018</small>"
    story_decorative_body: "In January, we received a DMCA from a European collecting society on behalf of one of its artist members. The notice addressed a group of photos on Wikimedia Commons showing the interior of an intricately decorated German church. We investigated and followed up with the organization for more detail. They explained that their artist client had created two pieces of art in the church and therefore held the copyright to these works. We removed photos of these particular creations. However, other images of the church’s ornate interior remain on Commons."

    story_police_title: "Police and Politics<br><small>September 2018</small>"
    story_police_body: "It’s not unusual for notable individuals to write the Wikimedia Foundation and ask us to remove information from the projects. It is unusual for the police to do it on their behalf. In September 2018, Italian police requested that we delete content from an <a href='https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagina_principale'>Italian Wikipedia</a> article about a politician. We directed them to the article talk page, where they could raise their concerns to project editors. Around the same time, Italian Wikipedia contributors were discussing various improvements to the article, many of which they carried out. Perhaps the resulting changes addressed the issue, because neither the police nor the politician has contacted us again."

    story_two_tales_title: "A City of Two Tales<br><small>July 2018</small>"
    story_two_tales_body: "When we get requests from governments, there usually isn’t a question if the sender is really in power. But uncertainty arose in July 2018, when trusted <a href='https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal'>French Wikipedia</a> volunteers received an email supposedly from the ministry of culture of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronation'>micronation</a>. Looking closely, the volunteers realized that this was an unusual case. Not only is the existence of this country disputed, but so is the role of the group who sent the email, an opposition organization claiming to be its official government. The emailer was angry that the volunteers uncovered this information. Of course, they are still free to edit like anyone else—but they should review the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest'>Conflict of Interest</a> policy, and make their affiliation clear."

    story_diorama_dilemma_title: "Diorama Dilemma<br><small>Multiple Months</small>"
    story_diorama_dilemma_body: "Throughout the summer and fall of 2018, the Wikimedia Foundation and trusted project volunteers corresponded with a Canadian museum, which requested that we remove from <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> a photo of a model of a woolly mammoth. We determined that relevant copyright laws allowed the image to appear on the projects, and suggested the museum continue their dialogue with the volunteers. The photo remains on the projects. We believe that information in museums, archives, and other knowledge repositories should be available online. Through <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/2019/01/24/we-applaud-the-cleveland-museum-of-arts-new-open-access-policy-and-heres-what-remains-to-be-done/'>GLAM</a> (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums)-wiki projects, the Foundation and communities partner with such institutions to bring their collections to Wikimedia users."

    story_viral_dmca_title: "Viral DMCA<br><small>August 2018</small>"
    story_viral_dmca_body: "Most of the material on the Wikimedia projects is in the public domain or freely licensed. Volunteer contributors patrol the site to ensure that content has been appropriately uploaded. In August, a company that makes anti-virus software contacted us to ask that we remove their logo from <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>. We received their message and went to examine the page, but found that Commons contributors had already removed the image. It is because of their hard work and diligence that the Foundation receives so few <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act'>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> requests to remove allegedly copyrighted content."

    story_name_of_my_name_title: "In the Name of My Name<br><small>August 2018</small>"
    story_name_of_my_name_body: "In August 2018, someone demanded that we remove an article about them from English Wikipedia. They claimed that they had copyrighted their name, and therefore, the article had to be deleted. A few months later, we received a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act'>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> takedown request from another person, who also claimed that their name was copyrighted, and therefore they could not be mentioned in a <a href='https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal'>French Wikipedia</a> article. In general, a person’s name isn’t copyrightable in most countries. Even if a work of art is legitimately copyrighted, that does not prevent Wikipedia contributors from referencing it in the encyclopedia. Both articles are still on the projects."

    story_name_return_to_sender_title: "Return to Sender? <br><small>August 2018</small>"
    story_name_return_to_sender_body: "Most requests that we receive are about content on one of the Wikimedia projects: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a>, <a href='https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Accueil'>French Wikisource</a>, <a href='https://zh.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5'>Chinese Wikibooks</a>, and more. These sites may have different kinds of content, but they come under the Wikimedia umbrella. Occasionally, however, someone mistakenly sends a request about a site that is not associated with the Wikimedia Foundation. In August, project volunteers received a lengthy <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act'>DMCA</a> notice about content on a long list of sites on a Ukrainian domain. The notice even expressed uncertainty whether it was addressed to the right party. While we’re happy to support projects that give readers information about a wide range of topics and links to all sorts of reliable sources, we do not control the entire internet."

      The Right to Erasure, or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten'>Right to be Forgotten</a>, is a right under the laws of various countries that allows individuals to request that certain information relating to them be delisted or removed. We receive two types of Right to Erasure requests relating to the Wikimedia projects: requests relating to project content, and requests relating to user accounts. In the past, we have reported these requests as one combined total; in this report, we are separating them to provide greater clarity about the Right to Erasure requests we receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we receive a Right to Erasure request regarding project content, we first direct the requester to experienced project volunteers, who routinely handle most requests to change content on the projects. Wikimedia projects have <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons'>guidelines</a> for content about living persons, and the volunteer community can review the guidelines and work with the requester to address their concerns. During this reporting period, we received 11 requests to alter or takedown project content based upon the Right to Erasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we receive a request relating to a user account, we provide the user information on the community-driven <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_vanishing'>vanishing</a> process. During this reporting period, we received 195 requests related to user accounts.

      <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/08/06/wikipedia-pages-censored-in-european-search-results/'>We believe</a> in a Right to Remember. Everyone should have free access to relevant and neutral information of public concern; delisting and removing such content from the internet harms our collective ability to remember history and understand the world. In October 2016, <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/10/19/petition-right-to-be-forgotten/'>we filed a petition</a> to intervene in Google’s appeal of a French administrative order that would expand such delistings from the European Union to all global domains. In July 2017, the French Supreme Court <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/07/31/global-search-engine-delistings-petition'>asked</a> the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice'>European Court of Justice</a> to address questions regarding the scope of right to erasure delistings, and we have <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/11/30/national-orders-global-delisting/'>submitted a filing to the ECJ</a> presenting our concerns.

    title: "Frequently<br>Asked Questions"

    q_information: "What sort of user information gets requested?"
    a_information: "<p>All sorts of identifying information, public and nonpublic, gets requested. Requests tend to be very broad in nature, in order to capture as much information as possible. However, most information on the projects is public: for instance, talk pages or information relating to a page’s edit history. We store very little nonpublic information. Some of it is collected automatically (such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'>IP address</a> of the user's device or their <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server'>proxy server</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent'>user agent</a> information), while other types of nonpublic information are optionally provided by the user (such as an email address). With some narrow exceptions, nonpublic information that includes personal information of any particular user is only kept for a short amount of time. You can learn more about the types of information we collect and how long we retain that information in our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy'>Privacy Policy</a> and <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines'>Data Retention Guidelines</a>.</p><p>In some transparency reports, you may have seen a distinction made between &ldquo;content&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-content&rdquo; information. This distinction comes from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a>, or ECPA (<a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703'>18 U.S.C. &sect; 2703</a> <em>et seq</em>.). &ldquo;Content information&rdquo; refers to the contents of user communications. &ldquo;Non-content&rdquo; information refers to data about those communications. One common (if imperfect) analogy for explaining this is the difference between letters and envelopes. The information visible on the outside of an envelope, such as routing information, is considered non-content information. On the Wikimedia projects, this might include user agent information, IP addresses, or email addresses. The letter inside the envelope, however, is considered content information. On the Wikimedia projects, one example would be information on a Wikipedia page, which is already public. Because of the public nature of the projects, we very rarely receive requests for content information.</p>"

    q_standards: "Does WMF have different standards for granting requests for user information depending upon who makes the request? How are these requests processed?"
    a_standards: "<p>No. Regardless of who is requesting user data—be it an individual, a government, or a law enforcement officer—the Wikimedia Foundation only discloses nonpublic user information in accordance with our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use'>Terms of Use</a>, <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy'>Privacy Policy</a>, and applicable U.S. law, including the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)</a> (<a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119'>18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;2510-2522</a>, <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121'>18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2701-2711</a>, and <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-II/chapter-206'>18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3121-3127</a>). We typically do not produce information as a result of a request unless we have received proper legal process. Submitted requests must be reasonable, specific and relevant. Requests must include contact information for the requester, and a specific deadline. Finally, requests must be legally valid and enforceable under United States law, in the form of a court order, subpoena, warrant, or request served under the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_legal_assistance_treaty'>mutual legal assistance treaty</a> or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_rogatory'>letters rogatory</a> process.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we may disclose information in response to emergency requests in accordance with ECPA (<a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2702'>18 U.S.C. 2702(b)(8)</a>) when there is a credible and imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm. These requests must meet specific criteria, including detailing the nature of the emergency, why it is believed to be imminent, and the specific information requested and how it is necessary to prevent the threat from being carried out.</p><p>For more information on the procedures for requesting user information and making an emergency request, see our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines'>Requests for User Information Procedures & Guidelines.</a></p>"

    q_request_abroad: "What happens when you receive a request for nonpublic personal information from abroad?"
    a_request_abroad: "
    <p>Per our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines'>Requests for User Information Procedures & Guidelines</a>, we require requests originating from outside of the United States to follow the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_legal_assistance_treaty'>mutual legal assistance treaty</a> (MLAT) process or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_rogatory'>letters rogatory</a> process, so that a U.S. court will issue the required U.S. legal process to the Wikimedia Foundation. The MLAT process involves a network of treaties between countries, which require them to aid each other in obtaining information used for enforcing laws. Letters rogatory are a type of request issued by a court in one country to a court in another country, usually seeking assistance to serve process or gather evidence.</p>
    <p>For content requests received from abroad, we evaluate the request to determine if it presents an applicable legal requirement in our jurisdiction and, if so, we respond to it appropriately. If it does not, we help requesters understand Wikipedia and provide them with information to work productively with the volunteer community.</p>

    q_my_personal_information: "Help! My personal information is being sought because of something I did on the Wikimedia projects. What should I do?"
    a_my_personal_information: "<p>If you are the subject of a subpoena, it is highly recommended that you consult your own lawyer immediately. There are a number of organizations that will fight on a user's behalf, like the <a href='https://www.aclu.org/'>American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) or the <a href='https://www.eff.org/'>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF). If you need help finding an attorney, WMF may be able to put you in touch with some of these organizations or help you secure an attorney at reduced or pro-bono rates. In rare cases, assistance may also be available under our <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal_and_Community_Advocacy/Legal_Fees_Assistance_Program'>Legal Fees Assistance Program</a> or <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal/Legal_Policies#Defense_of_Contributors'>Defense of Contributors Program</a>. Additionally, in certain situations, WMF may challenge a subpoena on a user’s behalf if it is unnecessarily broad or burdensome, or if we believe the subpoena threatens the free speech of users on the projects. For more information about subpoenas, see our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy/Subpoena_FAQ'>Subpoena FAQ</a>.</p>"

    q_information_produced: "What do you mean by &ldquo;information produced&rdquo;?"
    a_information_produced: "<p>When we say &ldquo;information produced&rdquo;, we mean that as a result of a legal process (such as a subpoena) that was legally valid, some or all of the nonpublic user information requested by that legal process was produced by WMF to the requesting party. &ldquo;Information produced&rdquo; also applies to rare emergency situations where we voluntarily disclose personal information to law enforcement, or produce such information in response to an emergency request, in order to prevent imminent bodily harm or death.</p>"

    q_information_produced_diff: "What’s the difference between &ldquo;information produced (partial)&rdquo;  and &ldquo;information produced (all)&rdquo;?"
    a_information_produced_diff: "<p>Beginning with  the July 2016 Transparency Report, we decided to provide additional information about the ways in which the Foundation responds to requests for user information. &ldquo;Information produced (all)&rdquo; refers to situations where we provided all of the nonpublic user information requested in the requester’s initial message to us. &ldquo;Information produced (partial)&rdquo; refers to situations in which we provided some nonpublic user information, but less than what was requested in the requester’s initial message. For example, this may happen when some of the information requested is information that we do not collect or store, when the requester asked for information that has already been deleted from our systems under our <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines'>Data Retention Guidelines</a>, or if the requester served us with valid legal process regarding some, but not all, of the information they wanted.</p>"

    q_content_info_diff: "Why don’t you report on the difference between &ldquo;content information&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-content information&rdquo;? What do these terms mean?"
    a_content_info_diff: "
    <p>The distinction comes from the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or ECPA (<a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703'>18 U.S.C. &sect; 2703</a> <em>et seq</em>.). &ldquo;Content information&rdquo; refers to the contents of user communications. &ldquo;Non-content&rdquo; information refers to data about those communications. One common (if imperfect) analogy for explaining this is the difference between letters and envelopes. The information visible on the outside of an envelope, such as routing information, is considered non-content information. The text inside the envelope, however, is considered content information.</p>
    <p>Because <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines#Types_of_Nonpublic_Information_We_May_Have'>the contents of the Wikimedia projects are largely transparent and public</a>, any  requests we receive are generally for non-content user information. For example, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent'>user agent</a> information, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent'>IP addresses</a>, and email addresses.</p>
    "

    q_informal_non_government_requests: "What do you mean by &ldquo;informal non-government request&rdquo;?"
    a_informal_non_government_requests: "<p>When we say &ldquo;informal non-government request&rdquo;, we mean a request for user information from a non-governmental entity that does not involve a formal legal process. For example, this would include a situation where a corporation sends us a letter or an email requesting nonpublic information about one of our users.</p>"

    q_informal_government_requests: "What do you mean by &ldquo;informal government request&rdquo;?"
    a_informal_government_requests: "<p>When we say &ldquo;informal government request&rdquo;, we mean a request for user information from a governmental entity that does not involve a formal legal process. For example, this would include a situation where a government sends us a letter or an email requesting nonpublic information about one of our users.</p>"

    q_civil_subpoena: "What do you mean by &ldquo;civil subpoena&rdquo;?"
    a_civil_subpoena: "<p>When we say &ldquo;civil subpoena&rdquo;, we mean a legal process received by the Wikimedia Foundation from a third-party individual or organization requesting nonpublic user information that usually relates to a legal dispute between two or more individuals or organizations. Civil subpoenas generally do not require review by a judge or a magistrate.</p>"

    q_criminal_subpoena: "What do you mean by &ldquo;criminal subpoena&rdquo;?"
    a_criminal_subpoena: "<p>When we say &ldquo;criminal subpoena&rdquo;, we mean a legal process received by the Wikimedia Foundation requesting nonpublic user information that is typically issued by a government attorney or <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury'>grand jury</a>, in connection with an official criminal investigation.</p>"

    q_administrative_subpoena: "What do you mean by &ldquo;administrative subpoena&rdquo;?"
    a_administrative_subpoena: "<p>When we say &ldquo;administrative subpoena&rdquo;, we mean a legal process received by the Wikimedia Foundation requesting nonpublic user information that has been issued directly by a government agency, without judicial oversight.</p>"

    q_search_warrant: "What do you mean by &ldquo;search warrant&rdquo;?"
    a_search_warrant: "<p>When we say &ldquo;search warrant&rdquo;, we mean a warrant issued under the procedures of the United States’ <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp'>Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a> or equivalent state warrant procedures, based upon a showing of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause'>probable cause</a> that specific information held by the Wikimedia Foundation may be related to a crime. Search warrants are generally reviewed by a judge or a magistrate.</p>"

    q_court_order: "What do you mean by &ldquo;court order&rdquo;?"
    a_court_order: "
    <p>When we say &ldquo;court order&rdquo;, we mean an order issued by a court directed at the Wikimedia Foundation. If an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, we will evaluate the request. For example, court orders for user data may be issued under various U.S. federal and state laws, such as section 2703(d) of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (&ldquo;ECPA&rdquo;). As another example, some court orders may require the Wikimedia Foundation to alter or remove content from Wikipedia. Such orders could come from a court in the United States or from a court in another country on a case by case basis depending on whether the facts gives rise to enforceable foreign jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, we believe a warrant is required by the <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment'>4th Amendment</a> to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution'>United States Constitution</a>, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure and overrides conflicting provisions in ECPA. We believe that ECPA needs to be updated so that equivalent protections are granted to electronic communications and documents that have already been granted to the physical documents one keeps at home or in their office. To that end, we are a member of the <a href='https://digitaldueprocess.org/'>Digital Due Process Coalition</a> to help in that effort.</p>
    "

    q_national_security_request: "What do you mean by &ldquo;national security request&rdquo;?"
    a_national_security_request: "<p>&ldquo;National security requests&rdquo; include <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter'>national security letters</a> and orders issued under the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act'>Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (<a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801'>50 U.S.C. &sect;1801</a> <em>et seq</em>.).</p>"

    q_wiretap: "What is a  &ldquo;wiretap&rdquo; or a  &ldquo;pen register&rdquo;, and why doesn’t the Wikimedia Foundation list them in its Transparency Report?"
    a_wiretap: "<p>A <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_tapping'>wiretap</a> order (see The Wiretap Act, <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511'>18 U.S.C. &sect; 2511</a> <em>et seq</em>.) is an order that requires the real-time interception of the content of telephone or internet communications. A <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_register'>pen register</a> order (see The Pen Register Statute, <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3121'>18 U.S.C. &sect; 3121</a> <em>et seq</em>.) requires the real-time interception of non-content information associated with telephone or internet communications (such as routing information). We have never received a wiretap or pen register order relating to activity on the Wikimedia projects. Should we receive such an order, we will disclose it in this report if allowed to do so by law.</p>"

    a_potentially_affected: "<p>This number represents the number of unique user accounts implicated by requests for user data and whose data would have been disclosed if we had granted every request we received. This number may not reflect the number of unique individuals implicated by requests for user data, since an individual may have multiple accounts across all Wikimedia projects, and we record each user account separately. As a result, this number might overestimate the number of individuals implicated by user data requests.</p>"

    q_actually_affected: "What do you mean by &ldquo;user accounts actually affected&rdquo;?"
    a_actually_affected: "<p>This number represents the number of unique user accounts whose nonpublic information was disclosed as a result of WMF receiving a valid request for user data. This number may not reflect the number of unique individuals whose data was disclosed as a result of a valid request for user data, since an individual may have multiple accounts across all Wikimedia projects, and we record each user account separately. As a result, this number might overestimate the number of individuals implicated by user data requests.</p>"

    q_legal_process_subpoena: "What do you mean when you say &ldquo;user accounts notified&rdquo;? When would you not tell a user that their nonpublic personal information is being disclosed as a result of a legal process, such as a subpoena?"
    a_legal_process_subpoena: "<p>We are committed to notifying users if we plan on disclosing nonpublic personal information. We added the &ldquo;user accounts notified&rdquo; category in the July 2016 Transparency Report to refer to the number of users whom we notified about such a planned disclosure. However, we cannot notify a user account if we are legally restrained from doing so (e.g., by a gag order), if a credible threat to life or limb is present, or if the user has not provided us with an e-mail address or valid contact information. Since one person may have more than one user account, and provide no, or different contact information for those accounts, the number of user accounts notified may not reflect the number of people notified.</p>"

    q_emergency_disclosure: "What do you mean by &ldquo;emergency disclosure&rdquo;?"
    a_emergency_disclosure: "
    <p>An &ldquo;emergency disclosure&rdquo; includes two types of disclosures: voluntary disclosures, and emergency requests.  &ldquo;Voluntary disclosure&rdquo; refers to a case in which we become aware of statements on the projects that threaten harm to the user who made the statements and/or other individuals, and—on our initiative—choose to disclose nonpublic user information to a law enforcement agency. Such disclosures are rare; they are made only in accordance with the exceptions outlined in our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#sharing'>Privacy Policy</a>, such as to protect you, ourselves, and others from imminent and serious bodily harm or death.</p>

    <p>An “emergency request” is a request made when law enforcement has contacted us because of an imminent threat to life or limb, and we have decided to release information according to the process described in our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines#Emergency_Requests'>Requests for User Information Procedures & Guidelines</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (see <a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2702'>18 U.S.C. &sect; 2702</a>). When we feel that a law enforcement request does not rise to this level, we classify it as an “informal government request” instead.</p>

      The Right to Erasure, sometimes called the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten'>Right to be Forgotten</a>, is a right under the laws of various countries that allows individuals to request that certain information relating to them be delisted or removed. We receive two types of Right to Erasure requests relating to the Wikimedia projects: requests relating to project content, and requests relating to user accounts. <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/08/06/wikipedia-pages-censored-in-european-search-results/'>We believe</a> in a Right to Remember. Everyone should have free access to relevant and neutral information of public concern. For more information about our concerns, see our <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/08/06/wikipedia-pages-censored-in-european-search-results/'>August 2014</a>, <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/10/19/petition-right-to-be-forgotten/'>October 2016</>, and <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/07/31/global-search-engine-delistings-petition/'>July</a> and <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/11/30/national-orders-global-delisting/'>November 2017</a> blog posts about intervening in a related case.

    q_different_compare: "How are requests for user data calculated differently by WMF as compared to other organizations?"
    a_different_compare: "<p>In our transparency reports, WMF includes all types of requests for user information it receives, including governmental and non-governmental requests as well as informal and formal requests. Some other organizations, including several of those appearing in the &ldquo;Compared to other companies&rdquo; graph in our report, only disclose requests originating from governments. Please visit the transparency reports of <a href='https://govtrequests.facebook.com/'>Facebook</a>, <a href='https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/'>Google</a>, <a href='https://transparency.twitter.com/'>Twitter</a>, and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency'>LinkedIn</a> for more details about the types of requests they receive.</p>"

    q_public_information_included: "Are requests for public information included in requests for user data?"
    a_public_information_included: "<p>No, any requests for purely publicly available information are not included in this report.</p>"

    q_improve_laws: "What is WMF doing to help improve laws related to disclosure or surveillance of user information?"
    a_improve_laws: "
        <p>Our core <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Sue_Gardner/Wikimedia_Foundation_Guiding_Principles'>values</a> of freedom of speech and access to information can be threatened by laws that compromise user privacy. For this reason, the Wikimedia Foundation has joined the fight to improve privacy laws around the world.</p>
        <p>In 2013, we joined the <a href='https://digitaldueprocess.org/'>Digital Due Process Coalition</a> (DDPC), an organization focused on reforming the United States <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (ECPA). ECPA specifies standards for law enforcement access to electronic communications and associated data, thereby providing a degree of privacy to users of digital communication services. However, ECPA was enacted in 1986, meaning that it does not adequately protect users anymore, and only serves to provide inconsistent standards for law enforcement when dealing with &ldquo;new&rdquo; technologies. The DDPC’s mission is to simplify, clarify, and unify ECPA standards—providing clearer privacy protections for users, while taking into account changes in technology and usage patterns, and preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the laws and protect the public.</p>
        <p>In 2014, <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/05/09/opposing-mass-surveillance-on-the-internet/'>we signed</a> onto the <a href='https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles/'>Necessary and Proportionate Principles</a>, which support the application of human rights to mass surveillance and set forth basic principles to which governments should adhere when employing modern surveillance technologies. In March 2015, we took an even stronger stand. The Wikimedia Foundation joined eight other co-plaintiffs in <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/03/10/wikimedia-v-nsa/'>filing a lawsuit</a> against the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency'>U.S. National Security Agency</a> over its <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_collection'>&ldquo;Upstream&rdquo; mass surveillance practices</a>, which capture communications passing through the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone'>Internet &ldquo;backbone.&rdquo;</a> While the claims of all plaintiffs were originally <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/10/23/wikimedia-v-nsa-lawsuit-dismissal/'>dismissed</a> by the district court, in May 2017, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href='https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/05/23/wikimedia-nsa-appeal-standing/'>ruled</a> that the Wikimedia Foundation has standing to proceed. We strongly oppose mass surveillance by any government or entity, and hope that this lawsuit becomes an important step in enacting change. For more information, see our <a href='https://policy.wikimedia.org/stopsurveillance/'>resources page</a> on the case.</p>

    q_resolve_content_disputes: "How do users resolve content disputes and decide what should appear on the Wikimedia projects?"
    a_resolve_content_disputes: "
      <p>
        All content on the Wikimedia projects is written, uploaded, edited, and curated by people like you from around the world. Volunteer contributors jointly develop and enforce the policies and procedures that govern the content on the projects. This means that users decide what should and shouldn’t be included on the projects, keeping in mind both U.S. law and the particular project’s own policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each community has policies and procedures to handle disputes about whether certain content belongs on a particular project or meets that project’s standards. When a third party has a Wikipedia article written about them and doesn’t like some of the content included in that article, their first step should be to reach out to the community itself, as opposed to the Wikimedia Foundation.
      </p>
    "

    q_im_being_sued: "Help! I’m being sued because of something I did on the Wikimedia projects. What should I do?"
    a_im_being_sued: "
    <p>Lawsuits against Wikimedia users are exceedingly uncommon—most disputes about content are resolved by working with the user community through community-driven processes. In fact, individuals and organizations that sue over content they wish to remove from the public eye often end up causing that content to receive greater public attention as a result of the lawsuit, a phenomenon known as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect'>Streisand Effect</a>.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event that you are the subject of a lawsuit, it is highly recommended that you consult your own lawyer. There are a number of organizations that will fight on a user's behalf, like the <a href='https://www.casp.net/'>California Anti-SLAPP Project</a> or the <a href='https://www.eff.org/'>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF). If you need help finding an attorney, WMF may be able to put you in touch with some of these organizations or help you secure an attorney at reduced or pro-bono rates. Additionally, in rare cases, assistance may also be available under our <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal_and_Community_Advocacy/Legal_Fees_Assistance_Program'>Legal Fees Assistance Program</a> or <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal/Legal_Policies#Defense_of_Contributors'>Defense of Contributors Program</a>.</p>
    "

    q_remove_content: "Does WMF ever remove content?"
    a_remove_content: "
      <p>
        The vast majority of questions about content on the projects are ably handled by volunteer contributors. Absent the receipt of a legally valid <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act'>DMCA notice</a>, the Wikimedia Foundation supports community processes of evaluating and improving project content, and will generally only remove content in exceptional circumstances. For example, we once removed a blogger’s unredacted travel visa after somebody else posted the image with the blogger’s private information exposed.
      </p>
    "

    q_dmca_valid_proper: "What makes a DMCA takedown notice &ldquo;valid&rdquo; or &ldquo;proper&rdquo;?"
    a_dmca_valid_proper: "<p>The DMCA has several <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Notice_from_copyright_owner'>formal requirements</a> for notices. However, our evaluation isn’t over when we receive a notice that meets all of these requirements. We will also analyze the copyright eligibility of the work being infringed, whether the allegedly infringing material actually infringes, and whether the allegedly infringing material is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use'>fair use</a> of the requester’s work. For more information, see our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/DMCA_Policy'>DMCA Policy</a>.</p>"

    q_transparent_dmca: "How are you transparent about particular DMCA removals besides in this transparency report?"
    a_transparent_dmca: "<p>We record every DMCA takedown request that results in removal of content on <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Category:DMCA'>our website</a>. In addition, every DMCA removal is submitted to the <a href='https://lumendatabase.org/'>Lumen database</a> (Lumen), a web archive managed by the <a href='https://www.eff.org/'>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and several law school clinics. By collecting takedown notices from a variety of sources, Lumen provides a large set of data for analysis and allows recipients and senders of takedown notices to learn more about how the DMCA operates in the current online environment.</p>"

    q_counter_notices: "What is a DMCA counter-notice, and did you receive any?"
    a_counter_notices: "<p>When material is removed due to a DMCA takedown notice, the uploader of that content or a third party may believe that it did not violate copyright laws. If so, they may send us <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/DMCA_Policy#If_you_are_an_uploader_of_content.E2.80.A6'>a DMCA counter-notice</a>, stating their belief that the content did not infringe any copyrights. If the counter-notice complies with the statute, we will restore the content within 10-14 business days unless a lawsuit is filed by the copyright holder. Prior to the July 2016 Transparency Report, we had not received any DMCA counter-notices. Between January and June 2016, we received two. We have received no subsequent counter-notices.</p>"

    q_six_month: "Why is the information from July 2012 - June 2013 not available in six-month increments like the information from July 2013 forward?"
    a_six_month: "<p>During the July 2012 - June 2013 period, we recorded totals only for the entire period, rather than breaking the totals into six-month terms. In order to provide a better comparison with other reporting organizations, we changed the date ranges for our charts to line up with the timelines used by those organizations starting in July 2013.</p>"

    q_count_requests: "How do you count requests?"
    a_count_requests: "<p>Each request received counts as one request in the Transparency Report, irrespective of the number of webpages, content, or users that request deals with. For example, a request for user information that asks for the information of three users counts as one request for user data, and a DMCA takedown request that requests the removal of five images is counted as one DMCA request. Duplicate requests regarding the same matter from the same requesting party are also counted as one request. For example, if a requesting party sends us multiple demand letters to take a particular Wikipedia article down, it counts as one request.</p>"

    q_targeted_takedown: "What do you mean when you say a project was &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; by a takedown, alteration, or DMCA request?"
    a_targeted_takedown: "<p>It means that a particular project would have been altered if we had granted a particular request or that a particular project was actually altered due to a particular request. For example, if the Transparency Report indicates that French Wiktionary was targeted by one content alteration request, it means that we received a content alteration request that demanded that we change content on French Wiktionary.</p>"

    q_projects_affected: "Do you have data for projects potentially and actually affected from July 2012 to June 2013?"
    a_projects_affected: "<p>No, we started tracking requests in more detail beginning in July 2013, so this level of detail is not available for July 2012 to June 2013.</p>"

    q_writs_act: "Have you ever received an order under the All Writs Act?"
    a_writs_act: "<p>No. The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Writs_Act'>All Writs Act</a> (<a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1651'>28 U.S.C. &sect; 1651</a>) allows federal courts to issue all orders &ldquo;necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions&rdquo;. The Act has been used as a basis for orders requiring technology companies to access password-protected information. Thus, some technology companies and organizations may report All Writs Act requests in their transparency reports. We have not received such an order. If we do, and we are legally able to do so, we will include it in this report.<p>"

    q_preservation_request: "What do you mean by &ldquo;preservation request&rdquo;?"
    a_preservation_request: "<p>A preservation request is an order from the U.S. government under the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (<a href='https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703'>18 U.S.C. &sect; 2703(f)</a>). It requires us to retain information that would otherwise be deleted, anonymized, or aggregated within 90 days, according to our <a href='https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines'>Data Retention Guidelines</a>. If we receive one of these requests, we are legally required to retain the specific information indicated. However, <strong>we will not turn this information over to the requesting party unless they subsequently follow our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines'>Requests for User Information Procedures & Guidelines</a>, and obtain a legal order, such as a subpoena or warrant, for the information in question</strong>. A preservation request requires us to preserve something. We will never produce information in response to a preservation request, and simply because we have preserved information does not mean that the party will follow the proper steps and obtain an order requiring us to produce it later.</p>"
